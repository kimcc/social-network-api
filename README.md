The Social Network API is an API for a social media application where users can share their thoughts, react to their friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

Through the API, you're able to get all users, get a single user, add a new user, update a user, and delete a user. You can add a new friend to a user's friend list, and delete a user from the friend list. You're also able to get all thoughts, get a single thought, add a new thought, update a thought, and delete a thought. Finally, you're able to add a reaction to a thought, and delete a reaction to a thought.
